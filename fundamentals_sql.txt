1.
Adding:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, id)
VALUES ('value1', 123, 1);

Updating:
We can use multiple arguments/operators for our SET and WHERE, using SET to specify the value for a column, and WHERE to choose a specific row/circumstance depending on the arguments.
Ex:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1='xyz'
WHERE id=1;

To update/alter the schema, we use ALTER TABLE, and can optionally set records to have a default value for that column:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN name text
SET DEFAULT 'John Doe';

Deleting:
To delete a record/row:
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE id=1;

To delete columns in the schema:
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column2;

To delete the table in its entirety:
DROP TABLE table_name;

2.
The structure for our SQL commands is straight-forward since it is declarative, however we must issue our commands in a certain order. Typically, we will start with a command (in all caps, such as SELECT) followed by an argument (*, name, column2, etc). We can further modify that initial command, but only as long as we follow the expected order - for instance, we first have to specify which table to SELECT using FROM before we can create conditionals using WHERE:
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE id=2;
If our WHERE and FROM statements were swapped, we would not have a successful query.

3.
There are many data types that can be used in tables - for instance, we can to keep track of inventory in a store numerically (integer), we may assign each product a unique id (primary key for that table, again numeric/integer), then provide a description of it (text), the date it was added to the inventory (date), its cost (currency, money, or numeric), and the timestamp when it was sold (timestamp).

4. Wedding dinner table schema:
first_name and last_name would be text data types, since we expect their names to be some text (Jane Doe, John Smith, etc).
guests would be a numeric integer data type, since we want to know the exact number.
RSVP would be a boolean data type, since we only need to track if they've responded to attend or not attend.
Number of meals would be a numeric float data type, since we are interested in tracking decimals with the 1/2 meal for children.

CREATE TABLE wedding (
  first_name text,
  last_name text,
  RSVP boolean,
  guests integer,
  meals float
);

ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thanked boolean;

ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN meals;

ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table_number int;

ALTER TABLE wedding DROP column table_number;

5. Library table:
CREATE TABLE library (
  ISBN integer,
  title text,
  author text,
  genre text,
  pubDate date,
  total integer,
  available integer
)

INSERT INTO library (isbn, title, author, genre, pubDate, total, available)
  VALUES
  (978-0553213119, 'Moby Dick', 'Herman Melville', 'Classical', 10/18/1851, 2, 1)
  (978-0525520375, 'There There', 'Tommy Orange', 'Fiction', 06/05/2018, 40, 20)
  (978-1406711288, 'The Stranger', 'Albert Camus', 'Philosophy', 06/01/1941, 30, 15);

UPDATE library
SET available = 29
WHERE isbn = 978-1406711288;

DELETE FROM library WHERE isbn = 978-0525520375;

6. Spacecrafts table:
CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
  id integer,
  name text,
  launch date,
  origin text,
  mission text,
  orbiting text,
  operating boolean,
  distance integer
);

INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, launch, origin, mission, orbiting, operating, distance)
  VALUES
  ( 1, 'Tobias', 05/13/2050, 'Norway', 'Mine a space asteroid for gold', 'XE-2314', TRUE, 500000 )
  ( 2, 'SS Brigg', 01/17/2032, 'Germany', 'Seeking extraterrestrial life', 'Venus', TRUE, 162000000 )
  ( 3, 'Ares', 02/11/2021, 'New Canada', 'Destroy other spacecrafts, 'Mars', FALSE, 33900000 )

DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE spacecrafts SET operating = FALSE WHERE id = 1;

7. Emails table:
CREATE TABLE emails (
  id integer,
  subject text,
  sender text,
  recipients text,
  body text,
  timestamp timestamp,
  read boolean,
  chainid integer
);

INSERT INTO emails (id, subject, sender, recipients, body, timestamp, read, chainid)
  VALUES
  ( 1, 'You WON!!!', tim@email.com, john@email.net, "You've won this new electric blender! Click here!", 1557899013, FALSE, 4 )
  ( 2, 'Happy mother's day!', son@email.com, mom@email.net, "Happy mothers day mom, you're the greatest", 1557899023, TRUE, 2 )
  ( 3, 'Homework?', student@email.com, teacher@email.net, "I missed class today, I was wondering if there was any homework?", 1557899016, TRUE, 1 )

  DELETE FROM emails WHERE id = 1;

  UPDATE emails
  SET read = FALSE
  WHERE id = 3;
